## Events
Random events are one of the things that make the game world feel full and exciting. When a player doesn't know what's awaiting him behind the corner it builds suspense and excitment, unsure of what will happen. Down bellow we'll go through couple of such events which will be backed by superstitions found in our own world and we'll do our best to explain them in detail. 

### Whistling at night
Superstition originating from native american tribes who belive that whistiling at night invites skinwalkers or shapeshifters to whistle back. These shapeshifters are said to be able to read the minds and feed on the individuals fears. 

In game we are running into a couple of problems, first is this event should be triggable only in certain areas. It should never happen in a city or busy areas. Or even if it does the creatures should be more conservative. Maybe a fun idea would be that once a person or a player whistles in the dark, the skinwalker would bind to them so to say. Meaning that until either player or the skinwalker die, the skinwalker would be stalking and trying to kill the player. 

Aggressive creature: [Skinwalker](#skinwalker)

Checks (event can initiate): 
+ Must be night (not dusk or dawn, pitch black night)
+ There must be a dark spot on the map able to hide a skinwalker
+ Behaviour changes based on whether its happening in [wilderness](map#wilderness) ([forest](map#forest)) or [city](map#city).
+ Can only happen in [forest](map#forest) biome
+ Character muss whistle



Scenario: Player is walking in the town at night and he uses his [whistle emote](./gameplay#emotes). After the emote is done, and before the music fades back in, the distant whistle is heard and a visual notes indicating that the whistle is coming from the dark. A [perceptive](gameplay#perception) player might even see two icey blue eyes staring in the dark. Since player is in lit up city and there isn't much dark, the skinwalker won't initiate the combat or show itself. However, if player walks towards the skinwalker, a low inhuman growl will be heard from the spot. And if player comes close enough, the skinwalker will jump out and ambush the player. 
However, if player walks away from the skinwalker, over the next 3-5 days the frequency of whistles, which will intensifiy into inhuman growls as days pass will increass, until one day player will get attacked by the skinwalker.
