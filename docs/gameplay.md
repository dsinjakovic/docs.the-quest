### Maintanance Items

### Item degradation and repairs

Item durability should have 2 stages of durability, **durability** and **maintanance**.

**Durability** will be the normal 0-100 value that will determin how the item will perform. The lower the durability is, higher the chance of item breaking down. The curvature of how likely the item is to break should be covered by exponential decay (or growth idk). Meaning the less durability the item has the higher chance for the item to grow.

**Maintanance** will be another new value that can add half extra durability on top of **durability**, so 0-50 and will be applied by using certain [items](gameplay#Maintanance Items) like, sharpening stones, maintanance kits, etc. This kits will appy
